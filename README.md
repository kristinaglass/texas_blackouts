# Houston Blackout Areas in February 2021

# Introduction

"In February 2021, the state of Texas suffered a major power crisis, which came about as a result of three severe winter storms sweeping across the United States on February 10–11, 13–17, and 15–20." More background on the event can be found here: engineering perspective and political perspective. This blackout was caused to the several failures in the Texas power grid which was not optimized to deal with harsh winter weather.  At peak, over 5 million people were without power, at least 246 people were killed from the resulting outage and storm, but estimates are as high as 702. Total cost of damages were estimated to be at least $195 billion[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Texas_power_crisis)

## Area of Study

Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the 4th most populous city in the United States. It is home to over 2 million residents where an estimated 42.3% of people are homeowners. As of 2019, 20.1% of Houstonians lived at or below the poverty line[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston)

# Purpose and Method of Study

The purpose of this study is to estimate the number of homes in Houston that lost power as a result of the first two storms and investigate socioeconomic factors that could impact a communities ability to recover from a power outage.
